# RetentionKeeper - Compliance Document Archiver

## Executive Summary

RetentionKeeper is a CLI-first compliance document archival system that automates the capture, organization, and lifecycle management of business documents according to configurable retention policies. It addresses the critical need for regulatory compliance in document retention while providing complete audit trails for legal and regulatory review.

Organizations face increasing regulatory pressure to maintain proper document retention: SEC requires 7-year retention for financial records, HIPAA mandates 6-year retention for health information, and numerous other regulations create a complex web of retention requirements. RetentionKeeper simplifies this by providing policy-driven automation that ensures documents are retained as long as required - and no longer.

The system targets compliance officers, legal teams, and IT administrators in regulated industries who need defensible document retention without the cost and complexity of enterprise information governance platforms.

## Problem Statement

**The problem:** Organizations struggle with document retention compliance. They either keep everything forever (storage costs, legal discovery exposure) or delete too aggressively (regulatory fines, legal liability). Manual retention management is error-prone and doesn't scale. SEC fines for retention failures have reached hundreds of millions of dollars (Morgan Stanley: $13M, Goldman Sachs: $200M+).

**Current solutions:**
- Enterprise archives (Veritas, Commvault) - $15K+ licensing, complex deployment
- Manual retention policies - Error-prone, not auditable, doesn't scale
- Cloud archives (S3 Glacier) - Storage only, no policy management
- Email archiving solutions - Email-focused, not general documents
- SharePoint/file servers - No automated retention, no compliance features

**Our approach:** RetentionKeeper provides policy-driven compliance archiving:
- Declarative retention policies (SEC, HIPAA, custom)
- Automatic document classification by type and source
- Scheduled archival with full audit trails
- Legal hold support for litigation preservation
- Disposition workflows with approval chains
- Compliance reporting for audits
